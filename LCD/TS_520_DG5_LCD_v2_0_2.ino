Kenwood DG5 digital display emulator, V2.0.2 - LCD version


4/8/17 - Version 2.0.2  - Stability Enhancement added. Tests the HFO and BFO to see if they have moved more than 500Hz and 100Hz, respectively.
                          If not, keeps the last reading. This should help eliminate some wander/wiggle but keeping the two "fixed" frequencies stable.
                          Also lowered the averageing to 4 samples (from 10), makes display a little more responsive

Updates made April 2017 by Stephen Leander, KV6O
  - ported updated code back to LCD version from LED 
  - added correction factor (see variable "cf" in the "Frequency measurement variables" section
  - added smoothing/averaging to reduce display jitter
  - code cleaned up and better documented
  - this version uses FreqCount library rather than timer code by Nick Gammon
  - tested with latest Arduino IDE (1.8.2), you will need to get the FreqCount library under "Sketch/Include Library/Manage Libraries.."  
        Search on "FreqCount" and you should find Paul Stoffregen.  Install the latest version.

Stephen Leander, KV6O, April 2, 2017

4/4/17   - Version 2.0.1 - fixed averaging - display was using the raw "freq" var, not the avergaed one ("average")
                         - moved display logic into a function to make maintaining code between versions (LCD,LED,NIXIE) easier

Outputs Kenwood Commander commands on the Serial/USB port for a logging program (DXLab's Commander)
No idea if it will work with other programs because I haven't tested anything else!

Got the idea from Todd Harrison's website, Toddfun.com, where he outlined and built an Adrunio DG-5 emulator, with the plans of using this to display
the frequency, just like the DG-5.

Emulates a TS-790 for DX Commander, based on input from Dave, AA6YQ:

        >>>Note: Commander pays attention to the following bytes of the radio's response to an IF; command:
        
        3-13: VFO A frequency
        29: RX vs TX status
        30: Mode
        31: VFO selection
        33: split status
        
        >>>Operation won't be convenient unless your emulator can correctly report the radio's mode.
        
        
See http://www.kenwood.com/i/products/info/amateur/ts_480/pdf/ts_480_pc.pdf for more on Kenwood command set.


8/22/14 - Version 1.0  Prototyped the circuit using 3 TI PLL's (74HC4046A's), a 74HC93 counter for prescaling the HFO, and 74HC153 for selecting the 
signal (VFO, BFO, or HFO) to be counted by the Arduino on pin 5.

8/29/14 Version 1.1 - Added LCD display using 4-bit parrallel display type, added "freq" to have single calculated frequency for serial port and LCD.

9/9/14  Version 1.2 - Added DEBUG0;/DEBUG1; command line functionallity for turning on and off serial debugging

10/11/14 - Version 1.4 (abandoned 1.3, was attempt to make gate time shorter) Added USB/LSB/CW logic using BFO (CAR) frequency.

10/14/14 - Modifications to accomidate the V1.5 board.  Added SelectPinA/B for the new Arduino pins used for the select lines on the 153 (done to free up D2 and D3
            for the later addition of an rotary encoder - these are external Inturrupt pins).  Also had to flip the VFO/HET logic selection, not sure why!
            
10/17/14 - Change the counter gate time to 200ms (up from 100ms) due to the measured frequency being a little high (200-300 Hz) Not an issue on prototype, 
            need to troubleshoot.  Added "splash screen at startup" with adjustable call sign display during operation.

***********************************************************************************************************

1/17/16 - Version 1.6 - removed LCD code and added LED code.

1/17/16 - Version 1.6.1 - Added correction factor option, USB/LSB/CW display on LED, counter gate time back to 100ms

1/18/16 - Version 1.6.2 - added averaging routine to help with display jitter, cleaned up code, added commenting like a good person should.

4/24/16 - Version 1.6.3 - corrected error in calculating correction factor (was being multiplied by 8 for HFO)

4/25/16 - Version 1.6.4 - abandonded previous frequency counting method for the FreqCount library (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/FreqCount)
